# AnomalyDetection
### Demonstration of the various steps and methods involved in machine learning project.

The data we're working on is that of the intrusion detection system. The aim of this project is to apply various anomaly detection algorithms and, more specifically, to demonstrate the various steps and methods involved in a machine 
learning project. In this project, we show how to use various rules (such as the 80% rule) in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select the components that contribute most to the total variation in the data; we demonstrate
autoencoders for anomaly detection. Another interesting feature of this project is the fact that we show that the results are different when the data are separated (normal and abnormal labels) before being partitioned into training,
validation and test sets, as opposed to the mixed case (without separation).
