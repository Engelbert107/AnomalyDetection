# Anomaly Detection
# Purpose
To demonstrate the steps and methods involved in a machine learning project.
# Summary
The data used in this project comes from an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The goal is to demonstrate the steps and methods involved in a machine learning project.

In this project, we apply various anomaly detection algorithms and demonstrate how to use rules such as the 80% rule and the Cattell rule in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select components that contribute most to the total variation in the data. An interesting aspect of this project is showing how results differ when the data are separated into normal and abnormal labels before partitioning into training, validation, and test sets, compared to the mixed-case approach without prior separation.
