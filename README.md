# AnomalyDetection
# Purpose
Demonstration of the various steps and methods involved in a machine learning project.
# Summary
The data weâ€™re working with is from an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the various steps and methods involved in a machine learning project.

In this project we apply various anomaly detection algorithms and show how to use various rules (such as the 80% rule, Cattell rule) in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to select the components that contribute most to the total variation in the data. Another interesting feature of this project is the fact that we show that the results are different when the data are separated (normal and abnormal labels) before being partitioned into training, validation and test sets, as opposed to the mixed case (without separation).
